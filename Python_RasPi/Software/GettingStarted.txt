1) Activate python 3.5 environment with the command ~$ source activate py35
2) From the Modules directory, run Enrollment.py to scan RFID tags and save tag IDs to file.
3) Valves dispense precise amounts of fluid by opening for a specific amount of time. From Software directory, run:
~$ python Calibrate/Calibrate.py <valve number> <pulse duration> <number of pulses>
For instance, to add a calibration point of 30 ms for valve 1 with 200 pulses, run command:
~$ python Calibrate/Calibrate.py 1 30 200
then enter the amount of water dispensed when prompted. Use at least 3 calibration points. Calibration curves are saved in the 'Calibrate' folder.
